# Abusing Taxpayer Systems

> It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice

This great country of ours is, unfortunately, on a budget. The Court systems and the associated Law Enforcement systems can only handle what they can afford to.

These lawyers have done nothing but caused a distraction on numerous levels of the Court and Law Enforcement world through this process, as have the medical professionals.

My arrest in late April of 2023 was used largely to also perform psychiatric research, to much expense to the Brooklyn Police Department, though possibly at the benefit of their entertainment given how ridiculous it was.

In recent years in NY state alone due to changes in Discovery law, [dismissals rose from 44% to 69% in 2021 alone](https://manhattan.institute/article/destroyed-by-discovery-how-new-york-states-discovery-law-destabilizes-the-criminal-justice-system#:~:text=In%20the%20five%20counties%20of,2021%2C%20according%20to%20court%20data.).

If these lawyers, working with or without medical professionals, engaged at all with Law Enforcement, it has been prejudicial to the very administration of justice itself across the entire system to which they have the _privilege_ of interacting, and misconduct must be considered for their abuse of this privilege which has only stolen resources that could have gone to almost anything more worthwhile.
