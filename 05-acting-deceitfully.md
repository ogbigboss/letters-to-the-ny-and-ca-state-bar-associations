### My parents motivations aren't realistic and the lawyers are being deceitful in holding this back from my parents

My parents are motivated to play along with this shenanigan for one reason only: helping my sister to retain custody of her children, my parent's grandchildren. The lawyers coordinating this medical malpractice, amongst other things, are being deceitful to my parents in numerous ways:

1. They clearly have not told my parents the details of my sister's false claim, though I'm OK with that personally, I imagine my parents would have trouble believing it and would ask my sister for more details, which would lead to further trouble believing it. Also they'd probably remember the car theft happening on the same day as well.
2. Since May 19th 2024, when it became widely known that my sister's false claim was a provable perjury due to a car theft occuring on the same day, my parents have no realistic opportunity at custody. Though the lawyers representing my sister would want her to tell my parents this, and the lawyers in NY / NJ coordinating the medical malpractice have no connection to the divorce, both groups of attorneys are acting prejudicially and deceitfully towards my parents.
3. This is hurting my parents finances as without this information, they feel a need to stay in their NJ residence to continue this attempt at what they think will help them with custody of their grand children. Otherwise, they wouldn't be eating into their savings to maintain a house which is too expensive for them now that they're retiring.
4. Both sets of lawyers are *colluding* with each other to withold this information from my parents for their own benefit in court.
5. Either set of lawyers could at least cancel the contracts and shut down the recording equipment given my parents only allowed for any of this in the now false hope that they will not receive custody
