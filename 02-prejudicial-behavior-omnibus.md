### Keeping a Surveillance System Running Past it Having Immediate Utility For The Purposes It Was Created

You and a production company set up this surveillance system in my parent's house to attempt to provide proof to what later turned out to be a perjury provable by a car theft report you could have looked up yourself. And yet, over a month after knowing the original purpose of the surveillance system was moot, you keep it running. Is there any other value than harming the person you are in question for wrongfully harming due to a lack of informed consent? Is a lawyer's pride reason to overlook prejudicial behavior? Let the NY State Bar be the Judge! Or, turn the cameras off.
