# Prejudicial Behavior Omnibus

> It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice

## The Hillside Avenue "Male Karen" Incident

On August 29th, 2023, on Hillside Ave in Montclair NJ, an individual accosted me and then used that interaction to say I had "psycho eyes" and was harassing them, knowing a police car normally parked a block away on Orange and Hillside Ave. They immediately accosted the police officer and attempted to have me arrested for, well, anything.

The officer of course declined as I wasn't doing anything illegal.

I am highly suspicious this individual was working in tandem with the lawyers, and was purposefully attempting to have me arrested given that I myself had hearings later that year in early October for charges which I was not convicted for and did not plead guilty to, but had I been arrested that day on August 29th via a technique known colloquially as "Karen-ing", I may have faced difficulty with that separate legal situation.

This was clearly, if the individual had any connection to the lawyers facing misconduct charges, indirectly or tangentially through their social groups, an attempt to harm the proper administration of justice. A partial video of the incident can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lee1qgeu5epqk44dw6j2l/IMG_0642.MOV?rlkey=3b82x77p6dx21wnuxzd77cyq7&dl=0).

## The Surveillance System delayed an administration of Justice by being indirect vs. just telling me what you idiots were on about

Please see a detailed run down of how the surveillance system only delayed an administration of justice and was prejudicial to me in the process in this subsection of [Lawyers Are Not Doctors](https://github.com/ogbigboss/letters-to-the-ny-and-ca-state-bar-associations/blob/main/01-lawyers-are-not-doctors.md#no-it-did-not-help-prove-anything-but-a-perjury).

### Keeping a Surveillance System Running Past it Having Immediate Utility For The Purposes It Was Created

You and a production company set up this surveillance system in my parent's house at first for a psychiatric research many would claim as medically unethical and therefore medical malpractice, and later as an attempt to provide proof to what later turned out to be a perjury provable by a car theft report you could have looked up yourself. And yet, over a month after knowing the original purpose of the surveillance system was moot, you keep it running.

This is clearly harmful, or prejudicial, to me as others have access to the system and are claiming to make their own TV show with the footage you will deny making, preventing me from being taken out of this horrific situation as those certain others are threatening to sue anyone who saves me for interrupting their TV show being made off of equipment you setup with a separate production company? (I'll admit there's a possibility others have tricked my parents into installing a separate set of surveillance cameras by posing as the lawyers who set the first one up, but this is not something I can confirm at this point, and frankly something the original lawyers can undo by explaining the situation to my parents without violating their client attorney privileges with my sister the perjurer).

Is there any other value than harming the person you are in question for wrongfully harming? Is a lawyer's pride reason to overlook prejudicial behavior? Let the NY State Bar be the Judge! Or, turn the cameras off.

### Keeping a Speaker System in the Vents Active Where I sleep Despite the Psychological Research It Was Installed For Being Cancelled nearly 6 Months Ago

Why is this speaker still in the vents? Why were others outside the lawyers themselves allowed to use it, particularly after an IRB deemed ******** university to be functioning against basic medical ethics? Why did the lawyers allow others to sleep deprieve and psychologically bully me for all but one day in the month of June with it, some 5 months after the research was deemed unethical?
