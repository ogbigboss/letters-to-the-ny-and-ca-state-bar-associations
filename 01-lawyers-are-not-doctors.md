# Lawyers are Not Doctors (And some Doctors are barely that)

If, as I presume, an IRB declared the psychiatric research to be medically unethical somewhere in early January, and this research was being conducted via the camera, microphone, and speaker system which was installed in my childhood home, then it is clearly beyond prejudicial for you lawyers to continue not only using it for your own ends, but to allow random interlocutors to use it as well for any reason what so ever.

If this was deemed to even be remotely harmful medicaly, then it is clearly harmful period, and being lawyers does not make that better or less grounds for misconduct.

### No, it did not help prove anything but a perjury

If this was used in an attempt to "administer justice", then it was clearly prejudicial to this as it only delayed the administration of such a thing, interrupted it's ability to be more properly addressed within a California Bar Court hearing, and resulted in slandering my name which would clearly violate [ABA Rule 8.4 from the Model Rule of Professional Conduct](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_4_misconduct).

I also have to presume that via the above apparatus, one motivation to keep this was to use it as a "interrogation" device by feeding me hints of a false claim to see how I'd react. It only allowed me to piece together what the claim was, that it concerned a certain date, and finally allowed me to reveal on May 19th via the apparatus of the microphones that the claim was clearly a perjury. Here is a rough timeline, all within the year 2024.

January 17th - I was forced to have a dream where someone claimed I said something that I did not. In the dream, I reacted as such. At the time, I thought it was a prank considering how sordid the dream was, and thought it was a sign that the psychiatric experiment was over considering how immature it felt to me. The dream contained an individual to whom I knew to have graduated in the year 2002, and oddly enough before coming home to take the nap where I took taht dream, my father tailed a Tesla with a liscense plate containing that individual's name and the digits "02". I considered their inclusion in the dream to be a matter of happenstance memory, at the time.

March 3rd - Days after saying aloud that I thought this could be an attorney discipline hearing, and considered it to be over a misrepresentation purely of my mental capacity, I was outside on the porch and could hear next door someone listening loudly to a podcast, which wasn't normal behavior. The podcast spoke loudly of "the class of '02", and I thought about the above situation. When I went downstairs, my parents were watching _To Kill a Mockingbird_. I then began to wonder if this was a reminder to the dream I was forced to have January 17th, which had a similar theme, and began to wonder if what was said about me was more than a claim to have simply said something I would never say and have never said, and a claim that I had done something I would never do and have never done. I at the time did not know why "the class of '02", or the person tagged on the license plate, could have been important, as all I remember about that individual was that their age indicated that they may have graduated college in the year 2002, they had a slight lazy eye, and a thick NJ Italian-American accent. 

May 7th - While walking in the parking lot of the Montclair Art Museum, heading West towards my home, an older couple in their mid 50s heading East stated very loudly near me "how was the graduation?" It may have been a coincidence, but I then began to wonder if the claim about me concerned a graduation event of some sort.

May 19th - After 12 days of considering if it could be related, I realized in the year 2002 a car theft took place involving an individual I am related to who had such a simple, boring, loserish lifestyle that they did very little which would allow me to remember one of the few things I can remember about them in the year 2002, which was that they left the garage door open allowing my parent's car to be stolen while leaving the three of us in the house. I utterred this story out loud to the surveillance system on May 19th, 2024, and saw many reactions that seemed to indicate excitement. A number of odd behaviors that seemed to relate to this story seemed to stop after that, and I assumed an individual I am related to may have perjured themselves.

This is to say, it took me 12 days after being "hinted" over a nearly 5 month period via the camera, microphone, speaker, and general stalking of my life what the situation may have been in an effort to portray me as guilty of, and within 12 days after realizing what may have been said, I was able to put together how it was a perjury.

Had this approach not have been taken, and I was told directly of the lie, I would have been able to point it out much sooner than 5 months, I'd imagine.

This approach instead has allowed my name to be slandered as an alternative due to the open nature of the camera, microphone, and speaker system which I suspect is also shared via an open internet driven website.

Again, if this was used in an attempt to "administer justice", then it was clearly prejudicial to this as it only delayed the administration of such a thing, interrupted it's ability to be more properly addressed within a California Bar Court hearing, and resulted in slandering my name which would clearly violate [ABA Rule 8.4 from the Model Rule of Professional Conduct](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_4_misconduct).

### The DSM is not a Forensic Text

At several times past the first two weeks of January, it felt like lawyers were nit picking the DSM in an attempt to validate a false claim about my mental capacity, one that psychiatrists seem unwilling to confront in a consensual manner. This gives me the suspicion that lawyers were attempting to use the DSM as a forensic text in Bar proceedings to defend their mistatements against me.

The DSM-5 clearly states this in what is referenced to as [the Cautionary Statement](https://jaapl.org/content/42/2/132#:~:text=The%20Cautionary%20Statement%20clearly%20indicates,information%20contained%20in%20a%20clinical)
