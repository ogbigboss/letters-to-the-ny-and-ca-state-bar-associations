# The Number "Six" Thing

### Intentionally risking harm to prove a diagnosis is basically admitting you don't have proof enough to diagnose, and is medical malpractice

So, since I've come home to Montclair in August of 2023, my father does yoga, and counts out loud while stretching - normal enough.

However, since late September of 2023, he began to emphasize the number "six". He says it more loudly and with a separate cadence than the other numbers. If recordings have been made, these can prove that there is a decibel as well as timing difference to how he says the number before and after late September of 2023, and if medical ethics are to prevail, a psychiatrist may have to admit to this being part of the "research" that was taken without my informed consent. One time my dad even said "six six six", which was funny to me.

Interestingly enough, my father stopped doing yoga and speaking numbers out loud when he came home from California in late May, avoided it entirely through June, and only started it again this past Saturday, July 13th 2024, when I believe lawyers facing attorney misconduct committed arson in an attempt to lure me into comitting a crime, [see this write up for more](https://gist.github.com/ogbigboss/d086ff05fbc62be25b5af8cea58c7e80). As for the nearly two month pause in this activity, my assumption is the lawyers asked my father to stop after learning my sister very likely perjured herself making a false claim about my mental capacity which would question whether or not I could be diagnosed via her statements, which would of course make this exercise medical malpractice if it were of any intent to diganose me.

Assuming my father is under the direction of psychiatrists, or lawyers working with psychiatrists, when he emphasizes the number "six", I'd like to state why I think this is 1. bullshit if the intent is to prove a diagnosis of any kind and 2. bounds for medical malpractice.

#### Why this is bullshit if the intent is to prove a diagnosis of any kind

I am presuming the psychiatrists or lawyers have asked my dad to emphasize the number "six" purposefully because it is the birth card number of both my sister and mother, whom are six of clubs, and both of whom I do have difficulties with. If the hope of the psychiatrists is to prove a psychotic episode via emphasizing this number, such to prove I would perceive it as a sleight which does not exist, well, I find that to be bullshit.

If I really had such problems with a number as to think people were sleighting me simply by saying the number that takes place between "5" and "7", this would've probably happened a long time ago.

If getting my father to say the number more loudly has been in the hopes of "triggering" a psychotic episode, such to prove I am diagnosably schizophrenic, this is bullshit. If I was diagnosably schizophrenic, you wouldn't need to prove it via such mechanisms, or you would've been able to do it earlier.

If someone can verify without deceit ([or attorney misconduct](https://github.com/ogbigboss/letters-to-the-ny-and-ca-state-bar-associations/blob/main/05-acting-deceitfully.md)) or hiding information in a medically unethical way, that despite a psychiatric research experiment my father just started emphasizing this number on his own and wasn't instructed to by lawyers or psychiatrists, well, I'm very corrigible and tractable, and I guess I'll just be wrong!

#### Why this is bounds for medical malpractice

A bedrock purpose of informed consent, and where it would be considered medical malpractice when not abided to, is to let those undergoing any medical procedure or research know the _risks_ of the process, if any.

Personally, I feel it's a perceived abandonment on the part of my father to myself, his only son - he doesn't care that he's doing this to prove I have a diagnosis that otherwise couldn't be proven, and that just hurts my heart. Why would he want to knowingfully risk triggering a mental episode in me? Wouldn't a more fatherly thing to do, if I did have trouble with a number and was indeed so mentally incapable as to suffer a mental episode by hearing it, wouldn't it be more correct of him to say it more normally at the least, or maybe count in his head, or knowing there was a risk of harming my mental state, stop doing it after awhile?

Perceived abandonment, even if unrealistic, is of course how one can get Borderline Personality Disorder, or how BPD can be exacerbated if there is a risk of it.

No one has told me, or likely my father, that they are actively risking me developing or worsening conditions that are not being attempted to be diagnosed or treated, or even if BPD was on the table for the psychiatric experiment, in that case even with BPD I would still be of a mental capacity such to ask for my own personal consent for any such psychiatric experiments, and by not informing me of the risks or the _reality_ of the experiment taking place, this is medical malpractice.

Furthermore, if some state agency of any kind has given a "doctor" the right to diagnose me from afar without seeking my consent, and I have "covertly" been diagnosed as schizophrenic or something of the like, why wouldn't it be harm to then purposefully seek to trigger a reaction out of me for such a thing without at the very least first trying to treat me to reduce the potential for harm?

Finally, this went on for months, mostly between late September of 2023 to late May of 2024, and is now resuming. If doctors or lawyers must be partial "detectives," where is the 4th ammendment to say they should at least give it a rest after not being able to prove anything?

If they are just doing this to annoy me, I would have to say the lawyers present are being prejudicial, and this may have to be considered a portion of the [prejudicial behavior omnibus](https://github.com/ogbigboss/letters-to-the-ny-and-ca-state-bar-associations/blob/main/02-prejudicial-behavior-omnibus.md).
