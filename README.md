Oh for fucks sakes I haven't touched this "fictional" thing in over two months and I'm still here?

This was a bad idea. It was foolish to rely on Reality TV as a guiding construct for any legal actions whatsoever. Yes, this was criminal malpractice - it was at least medically unethical! Sure, maybe these lawyers should be disciplined for it, but in any normal case, a civil lawsuit or a criminal investigation would take place before any legal disciplinary review, and the idea that a rock star fueled reality tv show should influence any of that is... foolish.

But maybe I'm wrong and this'll all be over before I expound on the above!

I'm updating the name of this repo to reflect that the information may also be important to the California State Bar and Supreme Court, the latter of which may be deciding on an appeal to the former group's decisions on attorney discipline.

Almost two months since I verbally proved the false claim against me was a perjury due to a car theft report, and the surveillance system to which I verbally proved it through still exists in this house, along with the speaker system which has been used to psychologically harm me. Yes, the harm came from non lawyers, but is enabling prejudicial behavior less prejudicial than committing it? Were the kids blamed for thinking Joe Camel was a good reason to start smoking under age 18?

I've begun considering the possibility that this could be just a straight forward criminal investigation into coordinated medical malpractice. That would also make sense, if not more.

In any case: I'm not changing the name of this repository. Also, felonies on the part of lawyers imply a more straightforward disciplinary investigation and process, so I think this all still tracks.

And yes, I'll testify as and if needed, gladly. No, I will not try and be cute or show off during cross examination, to be clear. I just like to talk shit, I'll play it straight up, if we get to that part.

Still a fiction at this point, however.

So, I'm assuming the NY State Bar has received at least one to several complaints in writing against lawyers for their participation in the fiasco that has come to define my personal life as of late. I'm futher assuming that the NY State Bar and the associated Appellate Divisions of the NY State Court as well as the Grievance Committees that review such complaints, based on events pertaining to the California State Bar, have all felt the complaints against those Barred in NY are proved, and the next step would be to contact the lawyers the complaint was alleged against, which I have a hunch happened late last week.

The lawyers now must respond in writing to the complaints. I am assuming that contemporaneous to this very moment (see above date), they are attempting to craft an argument in defense of themselves and their blatant disregard for the conduct they are meant to uphold. The NY State Bar will review their response and then decide what action is to be taken. For details, please the [NY State Bar Association's Guide to Attorney Discipline](https://nysba.org/public-resources/guide-to-attorney-discipline/).

This repository is a collection of counter arguments to what I assume are the defenses being made by the lawyers whom have been complained against, as well as arguments and complaints of my own.

For now I'm just gonna create leading titles and blank files. I'd really prefer my life's aperture to become adjusted relatively soon so I can consider this all a part of my past, at which point I'll just leave things up to the actual lawyers. I have no guarantees of any change to my life happening soon, so I'm making a space for this just in case, and providing an outline to hopefully have a written and reviewable document before the lawyers in question can write to the bar themselves, as that would be funny to me. I'm hoping I don't have to elaborate further, but it's a nice creative exercise at the least as, due to the deceitful and fradulent nature of the lawyer's actions, I cannot confirm at this time that this is truly happening, so what cannot be proven remains a fiction to me.
