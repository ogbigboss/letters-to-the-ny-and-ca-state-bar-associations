# Letters to the NY State Bar Association

### 05-12-2024

So, I'm assuming the NY State Bar has received at least one to several complaints in writing against lawyers for their participation in the fiasco that has come to define my personal life as of late. I'm futher assuming that the NY State Bar and the associated Appellate Divisions of the NY State Court as well as the Grievance Committees that review such complaints, based on events pertaining to the California State Bar, have all felt the complaints against those Barred in NY are proved, and the next step would be to contact the lawyers the complaint was alleged against, which I have a hunch happened late last week.

The lawyers now must respond in writing to the complaints. I am assuming that contemporaneous to this very moment (see above date), they are attempting to craft an argument in defense of themselves and their blatant disregard for the conduct they are meant to uphold. The NY State Bar will review their response and then decide what action is to be taken. For details, please the [NY State Bar Association's Guide to Attorney Discipline](https://nysba.org/public-resources/guide-to-attorney-discipline/).

This repository is a collection of counter arguments to what I assume are the defenses being made by the lawyers whom have been complained against, as well as arguments and complaints of my own.

For now I'm just gonna create leading titles and blank files. I'd really prefer my life's aperture to become adjusted relatively soon so I can consider this all a part of my past, at which point I'll just leave things up to the actual lawyers. I have no guarantees of any change to my life happening soon, so I'm making a space for this just in case, and providing an outline to hopefully have a written and reviewable document before the lawyers in question can write to the bar themselves, as that would be funny to me. I'm hoping I don't have to elaborate further, but it's a nice creative exercise at the least as, due to the deceitful and fradulent nature of the lawyer's actions, I cannot confirm at this time that this is truly happening, so what cannot be proven remains a fiction to me.
